            <h4>Paragraph</h4>
<p>The term social in regard to media suggests that platforms are user-centric and enable communal activity. As such, social media can be viewed as online facilitators or enhancers of human networksâ€”webs of individuals who enhance social connectivity.</p>
<p>Observers have noted a wide range of positive and negative impacts when it comes to the use of social media. Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or online communities and can be an effective communicati
    on (or marketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments. </p>

    <p class="pClass1">In 1991, when Tim Berners-Lee integrated hypertext software with the Internet, he created the World Wide Web, marking the beginning of the modern era of networked communication. 
        This breakthrough facilitated the formation of online communities and enabled support for offline groups through the use of weblogs, list servers, and email services. The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction.</p><br><br>

        <p class="pClass2">Research from 2015 shows that the world spent 22% of their online time on social networks,[25] thus suggesting the popularity of social media platforms, likely fueled by the widespread adoption of smartphones.[26] There 
            are as many as 4.76 billion social media users in the world[27] as of January 2023, equating to 59.4% of the total global population.</p>
